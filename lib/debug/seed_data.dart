/// Idempotent on the *project* level — re-running finds each project by name
/// and reuses it instead of creating a duplicate. Which wins get added is
/// fully deterministic: each project's phrase list is cycled through in a
/// fixed order based on how many wins it already has, so running this
/// repeatedly (or on a fresh install) always produces the same sequence of
/// content — nothing here is randomized. "Build this app" has a shorter
/// phrase list that repeats sooner, so it's the one that reaches its
/// constellation's slot capacity (~160) after enough taps and exercises the
/// overflow fallback. Spiritual is left with no seed project, to exercise
/// that area's empty state.
///
/// [languageCode] picks which translation of the seed content to use (see
/// [_specsFor]) — matching [SettingsController.locale] so the seeded
/// projects read naturally in whichever language the app is already set
/// to, the same way every other piece of app-facing text does.
///
/// Idempotency is keyed on the project's position in the spec list (its
/// index — the same conceptual project across [_specsEn]/[_specsIt]/
/// [_specsRo]), not on its display name alone: a project already seeded
/// under an *older* locale's name is found via [_alternateNamesAt] and
/// renamed to the current locale's name in place (see
/// [ProjectRepository.renameProject]) rather than spawning a same-shaped
/// duplicate next to it. Switching the app's language and re-tapping "seed
/// sample data" is what triggers this — every previously-seeded project
/// just switches language along with the rest of the app instead of
/// leaving stale foreign-language leftovers behind.
