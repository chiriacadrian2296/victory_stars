/// The five kinds of star — the app's whole vocabulary for *one effort*,
/// at every point in time an effort can be in.
///
/// A star is always an effort (past, present or future); its
/// intensity is the intensity of that effort. Which kind it is says *when*
/// the effort sits in time and whether it's still burning:
///
/// - [nascent] — an empty slot on a constellation's shape, drawn but not
///   configured yet. Neutral white. Becomes [lit] or [unlit] once the user
///   fills it in.
/// - [lit] — a victory. A past effort, already made, already burning gold.
/// - [unlit] — a goal. A future effort, still dark, waiting to be lit (or
///   to die).
/// - [pulsar] — a habit. A present effort, done day by day: gold on the
///   days it's kept, dark blue the moment the rhythm breaks.
/// - [dead] — a deleted star. Keeps its place in the sky forever and
///   remembers what it was, so reigniting it brings back the same kind.
///
/// The graphic families (see `StarGlyph` and `ConstellationPainter`):
/// light/gold ([lit]), no light/dark blue ([unlit], [dead]), both
/// ([pulsar], depending on today), neutral white ([nascent]).
