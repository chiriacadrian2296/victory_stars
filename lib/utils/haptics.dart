/// A one-shot motor buzz, routed through a small native Android channel
/// (`MainActivity.kt`) rather than the `vibration` package directly — see
/// that file's own doc comment for why: the package always tags its
/// `Vibrator.vibrate` calls as `AudioAttributes.USAGE_ALARM`, which at least
/// one real test device (a Xiaomi phone) substitutes with a fixed-strength
/// vendor haptic regardless of the requested amplitude. Tagging the same
/// call as `USAGE_TOUCH` instead is what actually lets [amplitude] (1-255)
/// change anything.
///
/// A no-op everywhere but Android — nothing on the other end of the channel
/// on iOS/web/desktop, and none of those are this app's real target for a
/// motor buzz anyway.
