/// PARKED (2026-09-11): every call site now uses `SaveActionButton`/
/// `PillActionButton` (pill_action_button.dart) instead — the round
/// FAB-style disc didn't read as clearly against its background as the
/// pill shape does. Kept here rather than deleted in case the round shape
/// comes back; nothing in the app references this file right now.
///
/// The round primary action at the bottom of every form — save a star,
/// create a constellation — and its destructive sibling.
///
/// A form's disc is the clearest place in the app where the whole grammar
/// shows up at once: it's dark and flat while the form is incomplete, and
/// the moment everything required is there it fills gold and starts
/// glowing. You light it the same way you light a star — the same
/// lit/glow mechanic `SaveActionButton` now carries forward.
///
/// Was copy-pasted at three call sites with slightly different shadows.
/// [lit] now decides fill, glow and foreground together, so there's no way
/// to end up with a gold disc that doesn't work or a dead-looking one that
/// does — and an unlit disc keeps its [onPressed] so it can explain *why*
/// it isn't lit rather than sitting there inert.
