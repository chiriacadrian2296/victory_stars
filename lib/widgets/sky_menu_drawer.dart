/// The menu's actual content: the logo/tagline header, then every entry,
/// grouped into sections. Used two ways — inside [SkyMenuDrawer]'s
/// [Drawer] (unbounded height, scrolls the whole thing if it ever needs
/// to) and inside a [showModalBottomSheet] (bounded height, passed in by
/// the caller) — so this widget itself makes no assumption about which;
/// it just fills whatever height it's given, scrollable list on top,
/// Settings pinned below.
///
/// [detailed] (off by default, so the drawer stays exactly as tuned) is
/// the modal's own look: a bigger header, section titles brought back
/// (centered, under the now-bigger header — [detailed] centers this
/// whole thing more deliberately than the compact mode ever tried to),
/// and a one-line caption under every entry. The compact mode (the
/// drawer) skips all of that — with 6 sections and up to 3 entries each,
/// section labels alone cost it its "everything visible without
/// scrolling" fit on a typical phone, which mattered there and doesn't
/// in a scrollable modal.
///
/// Every entry reads the same way — a gold icon beside white text. There's
/// no second, dimmer tier any more: a muted vs. bright split within
/// entries. (Emoji leads were tried for the two "make something" entries,
/// but an emoji glyph carries its own baked-in color that can't be
/// retinted to the app's exact gold — next to a true gold [Icon] it read
/// as a mismatched, slightly-off yellow rather than the same color, so
/// every entry uses a plain [Icon] now.)
///
/// What each group is:
/// - **Search** — [onSearch] alone, first: the fastest way off "wander and
///   hope" navigation deserves to be found before anything else, not
///   buried alongside the statistics page it used to share a section with.
/// - **Activity** — the things you *make*: [onLightAStar]/[onNewConstellation]/
///   [onVisions] all sit behind one entry ("Light Your Sky") that opens a
///   small chooser mirroring the sky's own three levels (Supernovas/
///   Constellations/Stars) rather than claiming three rows of their own,
///   and [onShootingStars] — sketched in ahead of the feature existing.
/// - **Crisis** — [onAdmire] ("Find Your Light"), right under Activity: what
///   it's *for* (a place to go when things are hard, reached in as few taps
///   as making something) matters more here than it being its own category.
/// - **Data** — [onStatistics], a way of *looking back*.
/// - **Social** — [onFriends], sketched in the same way as Shooting Stars.
/// - **Info** — just the metaphor guide. Onboarding replay moved back to
///   Settings' debug tools (a dev aid, not something worth its own
///   first-class entry); the app's own about card lives there too — it's
///   a fact about the app, not a place to go.
/// - **Settings** — its own section like every other, last: the page
///   behind it has its own sections in turn.

///
/// Why build this by hand at all: [BottomSheet] (`enableDrag: true`)
/// already wraps its *entire* content — not just the handle — in a
/// drag recognizer of its own for exactly this follow-the-finger
/// behavior, but a descendant [Scrollable] (the menu's own [ListView])
/// claims the same vertical drag from the gesture arena first and never
/// releases it back up, even once genuinely at its own scroll boundary
/// — clamping physics keeps "owning" the gesture and just reports the
/// excess as [OverscrollNotification] instead of ceding it. And even if
/// it did cede the gesture, [BottomSheet]'s real animation controller
/// still isn't reachable from inside its own `builder` to drive
/// ourselves. Owning the whole frame sidesteps both problems at once.

///
/// [ScrollNotification]s (what an earlier pass here used) turned out
/// not to be enough for that: once a pull reverses direction, the
/// child list's own position is sitting at 0 with room to move, so
/// that reversal is a perfectly normal, in-bounds scroll to it — no
/// [OverscrollNotification] fires for it at all, just a plain

/// happened, too late to have stopped it from moving in the first
/// place. Patching that after the fact (snapping the list back to 0
/// again once its own position had already changed) sometimes
/// interrupted the *scroll activity itself* — an artifact of forcing a
/// programmatic jump mid-drag — which could fire a genuine
/// [ScrollEndNotification] while the finger never actually left the
/// screen, reading as an unwanted, premature "let go" and closing the
/// sheet out from under a still-held touch.
