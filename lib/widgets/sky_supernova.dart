/// Another alternative take on the same slot [SkyDecorations]/[SkyWisps]/
/// `SkyBlackHole` filled before it (see `NebulaScreen.build` — only one is
/// ever wired in at a time): 8 simple, lens-flare-style stars, one per
/// [LifeArea] — the shader (`shaders/sky_supernova.frag`) draws every
/// glow/ring/spike in the same shared gold, additively (`BlendMode.plus`,
/// like [SkyDecorations]/[SkyWisps] — a pure glow with nothing to
/// occlude); this widget's own [_SkySupernovaPainter] then draws each
/// area's own icon straight on top of that glow — a plain white fill, a
/// vivid gold-gradient border, and a slowly-rotating glow of the same
/// gradient (see [_paintOutlineIcon]) — with no attempt to occlude or cut
/// through the glow beneath it. A fragment shader has no way to rasterize
/// a font glyph on its own, so the icon happens here in Dart instead.
///
/// A whole family of "punch a hole in the glow, reveal NebulaBackground
/// through it" looks were tried here first — a dark navy icon as the hole
/// itself, a white icon floating inside a separate disc-shaped hole, a
/// hollow icon whose own interior was part of that hole — dropped
/// altogether (along with the disc-hole technique's own churn: a
/// per-star `saveLayer`/`BlendMode.dstOut` punch, then a single combined
/// spatial clip, then back, then an edge-of-screen containment guard on
/// top of that) once it added up to more moving parts than the payoff
/// justified, including a real bug (a disc straddling the screen's own
/// edge rendered solid black) and, after that fix, icons that vanished
/// near the screen edge instead of just sliding off it normally. Plain
/// icon-on-glow, this file's very first look, never had either problem.
