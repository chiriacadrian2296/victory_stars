  // vertices offset 36 degrees (pi/5) from those, right in between each
  // consecutive pair. On screen, [Icons.star]'s own glyph vertices land
  // on the *inner* angle here, not the outer one — the opposite
  // assumption had the long/bright rays shooting from the valleys and
  // the short/dim ones from the points, backwards from how a twinkling
  // star should read — so the inner angle gets the main (brighter,
  // longer) rays and the outer angle gets the secondary (dimmer,
  // shorter) ones. Both sized way down from the first pass (tuned for a
  // supernova far from the icon drawn on top of it, way too big for one
  // sitting right behind it) and shortened again since, three times over
  // now — each pass roughly halving the reach of the one before it. The
  // main rays' own taper is steeper still on top of that, so they thin
  // out faster toward their own tips instead of holding a near-constant

  // time it's down). Both wider and brighter as [charge] ramps 0 -> 1 —
  // an actual growing glow, not just a brightening one.
  //
  // This glow's own *reach* is roughly 1/chargeRate (where exp(-dist *
  // chargeRate) drops to a fixed fraction) — so interpolating chargeRate
  // itself linearly (mix(40.0, 2.0, charge), tried first) made the
  // reach 1/mix(40,2,charge), which barely grows for most of the hold
  // and then balloons in the last moment as the rate bottoms out — a
  // sudden jump right at the end, not a smooth grow. Interpolating the
  // *radius* linearly instead (chargeRadius below) and deriving the
  // rate from that keeps the actual on-screen growth even across the
  // whole charge.
  // Max-charge radius pulled in to half of what it was (1/4.0, was
  // 1/2.0) — still noticeably bigger than the resting glow, just not

  // A safety net regardless of how [glow]/[spikes] above happen to be
  // tuned: this canvas is a small, fixed square (see
  // `_MenuStarButton._glowCanvasSize`), and any term whose value is
  // still nonzero right at that square's edge stops dead the instant
  // the canvas does — a faint but sharp square silhouette around the
  // button instead of a glow fading into nothing. Ramping brightness
  // down to exactly 0 before [dist] reaches the canvas edge (in these
  // same world units) removes that edge rather than just hiding it
  // better. Starts even earlier now (0.18, was then 0.35, was 0.6): at
  // full charge, [chargeGlow] is still quite bright right where a
  // narrower window would begin, so the same amount of brightness had
  // to drop to 0 over too short a span — a visible edge where the glow
  // stopped, not the long, soft fade this is supposed to be. Starting
  // the taper earlier spreads that same drop over more of the canvas
  // instead.

  // blue; [chargeGlow] is in this mix for the same reason [nearGlow]
  // already was — without it, the held-button glow stayed fully
  // saturated blue right up until individual color channels clipped on
  // their own, which read as harsh rather than bright. Cool/neutral now
  // (was warm — 1.0/0.98/0.9 — left over from when this whole glow was
  // still gold): whitening *toward warm* is what a hot ember does, but
  // this glow is blue, and mixing blue toward a warm target just turned
  // it an odd purple on the way rather than paling cleanly.
