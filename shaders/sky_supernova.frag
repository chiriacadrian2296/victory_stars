// Another alternative take on the same slot sky_decorations.frag,
// sky_wisps.frag, and sky_black_hole.frag filled before it (see
// NebulaScreen.build — only one is ever wired in at a time): 8
// simple lens-flare-style "supernovas" — one per LifeArea (see
// lib/models/life_area.dart: the app already has exactly 8, fixed) — each
// a warm glow, a thin ring, a four-point star core, and a tapered
// four-point cross spike, modeled after a plain stock lens-flare graphic
// rather than any photographic nebula/black-hole reference. All 8 share
// the same gold color (an earlier pass gave each its own shade of yellow
// instead) — the 8 are told apart by the area's own icon, drawn at each
// one's center in Dart (see the SkySupernova widget's own painter) since
// a fragment shader has no way to rasterize a font glyph on its own.

// Exactly the number of LifeArea values — see sky_decorations.frag's own
// kSupernovaCount for the fuller reasoning: this set is fixed and closed
// (never grows), so a true Fibonacci sphere lattice — which needs its
// total count up front but gives the most even coverage for a *known*
// N — is the right tool, not an ever-growing placement scheme.
