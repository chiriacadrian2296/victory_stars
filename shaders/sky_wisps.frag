// An alternative take on the same slot/job sky_decorations.frag fills
// (see NebulaScreen.build — only one of the two is ever wired in at a
// time) — wispy, filamentary nebula clouds with bright glowing ridgelines
// threading through a softer body, plus a scatter of colored sparkle
// stars, modeled after a reference photo of a real Hubble-style
// violet/magenta/blue nebula rather than the spiral-galaxy look
// sky_decorations.frag went for. Deliberately not tied to the 8 life
// areas yet (no fixed placement, no per-area color/identity) — this pass
// is purely about nailing the cloud/star *visual style* first; scattered
// everywhere across the sky as loose patches, the same way this file's
// own coverage mask decides, rather than anchored to fixed points.
